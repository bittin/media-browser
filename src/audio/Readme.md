# Motivation

This is inspired by iced_video_player [`iced_video_player`](https://github.com/jazzfool/iced_video_player/).
The original code does not support audio files and needed quite some changes to play them.

The original code is under MIT license.

audio_view.rs shares calls from iced_video_player and cosmic-player
