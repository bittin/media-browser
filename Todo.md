# Todo list

## Origins

This project is based on the Alpha 2 of COSMIC Files. Most of the file management features have been removed. A media browser does not need to have multiple tabs for multiple directories. The tab feature is handy for showing search results, though.

The Video Player and the Design of the popover are from COSMIC Player of Alpha 4 and the Iced-Video-Player.

The audio player is also derived from it but heavily modified.

The Image viewer is currently the image_viewer widget from the iced project. There is currently no time to learn how to do it more like I would like it to work.

## Content

This is the history of the project as well as the bug-tracker and the list of implemented and planned features.

Open Features are goals that are planned for a 1.0 release (required features) or something that would be neat over the life-time of the project.

Positions ended with a ? are *stretch goals*. If it is possible AND somebody does the work, it would be good to have these. In 1.0 or later. In some cases the way to make them possible is a rewrite of one of the standard tools used. Which makes the effort explode way beyond the available spare time.

## File browser

#### Open Features

- optionally skip different media types in navigation?
- sort by release date / creation / modification time
  - adjust the sort options when just one type is displayed and more details are available?
- view files of only one type?
- find similar images in background? (duplo-rs runs very long, better started on the command line!)
  - fill a new tab with the similar image pairs for comparison. (not necessary as they are in a new directory anyway)
- find similar videos in background? (duplo-rs runs very long, better started on the command line!)
  - fill a new tab with the similar video pairs for comparison? (duplo-rs can be started again and will just continue. COSMIC media browser would have to run for months!)
